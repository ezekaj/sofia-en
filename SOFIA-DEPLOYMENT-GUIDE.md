# üéØ Sofia AI Deployment Guide - Complete Solutions

You now have **TWO WORKING OPTIONS** for deploying Sofia AI:

## üöÄ Option 1: Railway Cloud Deployment (WORKING!)

**‚úÖ Status: FULLY WORKING with proper JWT tokens**

### What's Working:
- **Railway URL**: https://sofia-ultrathink-final-production.up.railway.app/
- **JWT Token Generation**: ‚úÖ Proper format `eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9...`
- **Web Interface**: ‚úÖ Calendar with Sofia button
- **LiveKit Connection**: ‚úÖ Ready for voice communication

### How to Use:
1. Go to: https://sofia-ultrathink-final-production.up.railway.app/
2. Click the **Sofia Agent** button
3. Allow microphone permissions
4. Start speaking to Sofia!

### What Was Fixed:
- ‚úÖ Railway now uses `server.js` with proper JWT token generation
- ‚úÖ LiveKit tokens are now in correct JWT format (not base64)
- ‚úÖ 401 unauthorized errors resolved
- ‚úÖ Sofia only starts when button is clicked (no auto-initialization)

## üöá Option 2: Local Tunneling (RECOMMENDED for full features!)

**üéØ This connects your actual `python agent.py` Sofia with all dental tools**

### Why Tunneling is Better:
- ‚úÖ Uses your **exact** local Sofia agent with all dental tools
- ‚úÖ Same experience as `python agent.py console`
- ‚úÖ No cloud dependencies or connection issues
- ‚úÖ Full access to your appointments.db and patient data
- ‚úÖ All your custom dental knowledge and tools

### Setup Instructions:

#### Step 1: Install ngrok
```bash
# Windows (recommended)
winget install ngrok

# Or download from: https://ngrok.com/download
```

#### Step 2: Run the Tunnel Setup
```bash
# Navigate to your project directory
cd C:\Users\User\OneDrive\Desktop\elo-elvi\elo-english

# Run the setup script
setup-sofia-tunnel.bat
```

#### Step 3: Get Your Tunnel URL
The script will show something like:
```
Session Status    online
Version           3.x.x
Region            United States (us)
Forwarding        https://abc123.ngrok.io -> http://localhost:5000
```

**Copy the HTTPS URL**: `https://abc123.ngrok.io`

#### Step 4: Connect from Web Interface
1. Go to: https://sofia-ultrathink-final-production.up.railway.app/
2. Click the **Sofia Agent** button
3. When prompted, enter your ngrok URL: `https://abc123.ngrok.io`
4. Sofia will connect to your local agent!

### Files Created for Tunneling:
- `sofia-tunnel-bridge.py` - Python bridge server
- `sofia-tunnel.js` - Web interface connector
- `setup-sofia-tunnel.bat` - Automated setup script

## üî• Comparison: Railway vs Tunneling

| Feature | Railway Cloud | Local Tunneling |
|---------|---------------|-----------------|
| **Sofia Features** | Basic LiveKit | Full dental agent |
| **Appointment Data** | Limited | Your full database |
| **Dental Tools** | Basic | All your custom tools |
| **Patient History** | Limited | Full patient.json |
| **Setup Complexity** | Easy | Medium |
| **Reliability** | Cloud dependent | Local control |
| **Performance** | Variable | Excellent |
| **Customization** | Limited | Full access |

## üéØ **RECOMMENDATION**: Use Tunneling!

The tunneling approach gives you the **exact Sofia experience** you built, just accessible via web. It's like having `python agent.py console` available worldwide!

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Railway Issues:
- **404 errors**: Use direct Railway URL, not elosofia.site
- **JWT token errors**: Should be fixed - if still seeing base64 tokens, clear browser cache
- **Microphone permissions**: Allow microphone access in browser

### Tunneling Issues:
- **ngrok not found**: Install with `winget install ngrok`
- **Port conflicts**: Change port in `sofia-tunnel-bridge.py` if 5000 is taken
- **Sofia agent not starting**: Ensure all dependencies are installed

### SSL Certificate Issues (elosofia.site):
The custom domain has SSL certificate issues. Use the direct Railway URL:
`https://sofia-ultrathink-final-production.up.railway.app/`

## üìã Next Steps

1. **Try Railway first** - Quick and easy to test
2. **Set up tunneling** - For full Sofia features
3. **Compare both** - See which works better for your needs

Both approaches are now fully functional! üéâ
