# Sofia Voice Integration - Current Status

## Overview
This document clarifies the actual state of Sofia's voice integration as of the latest code review.

## What Works
- **Demo Simulation**: The investor demo shows scripted conversations that demonstrate Sofia's intended functionality
- **LiveKit Infrastructure**: The LiveKit server and SDK are properly configured
- **Agent Framework**: The Python agent using LiveKit's agents framework is implemented

## What Doesn't Work
- **Console Mode**: Despite documentation claiming `python agent.py console` exists, it's NOT implemented
- **Voice Connection**: The browser-to-agent voice connection fails to establish properly
- **Real Voice Interaction**: Users cannot actually speak to Sofia through the web interface

## Misleading Elements Fixed
1. **"Sofia Aktivieren" Button**: Changed to "Demo Starten" to be honest about simulation
2. **Status Messages**: Now clearly indicate "Demo-Simulation" instead of implying real voice
3. **Console Mode**: Added error message when trying to run non-existent console mode
4. **API Endpoint**: Added comments clarifying `/api/sofia/console` actually starts voice mode

## Current Implementation Details

### agent.py
- Only supports `dev` mode with voice via LiveKit
- `console` mode mentioned in docs but not implemented
- Now shows error when trying to use console mode

### Investor Demo (index.html)
- Now clearly labeled as "Demo-Simulation"
- Shows warning that voice integration is in development
- Uses scripted responses instead of pretending voice works

### Server Endpoint (/api/sofia/console)
- Misleadingly named - actually starts voice agent
- Tries to spawn `python agent.py dev` with LiveKit
- Should be renamed to `/api/sofia/voice` for clarity

## Recommendations

1. **Remove Console Mode References**: Update all documentation to remove mentions of non-existent console mode
2. **Rename API Endpoint**: Change `/api/sofia/console` to `/api/sofia/voice`
3. **Implement Text Mode**: If text-only mode is needed, implement it properly
4. **Fix Voice Integration**: Debug why LiveKit connection fails between browser and agent

## For Investors
The current demo accurately shows Sofia's capabilities through simulation. The actual voice integration requires additional development work to connect the browser microphone to the Python agent through LiveKit.
